    "Implement the `forces_moments`, `motor_thrust_torque`, and `update_velocity_data` functions in `chap4/mav_dynamics.py` as described in chapter 4. For the aerodynamic coefficients $C_L(\\alpha)$ and $C_D(\\alpha)$, use equations (4.9) and (4.11), respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are some useful code snippets and hints:\n",
    "* R = Quaternion2Rotation(self._state[IND.QUAT]) # computes the rotation from body to world frame\n",
    "* uvw = state[IND.VEL] # Extracts the u-v-w body axis velocities from the state vector\n",
    "* MAV contains the UAV parameters (i.e., MAV.mass gives the mass and MAV.gravity is the gravity constant)\n",
    "* In `forces_moments`, you will need to calculate the following:\n",
    "  * gravitaional forces\n",
    "  * Lift and Drag coefficients\n",
    "  * Lift and Drag Forces\n",
    "  * longitudinal forces and torques\n",
    "  * lateral forces and torques\n",
    "* In `motor_thrust_torque` you will do the following\n",
    "  * Use the quadratic formulate to solve for motor speed\n",
    "  * Use the resulting values to compute the angular speed of the propeller\n",
    "  * Compute and return the thruse and torque due to the propeller\n",
    "* In `update_velocity_data` you will do the following\n",
    "  * Convert the wind vector to the body frame\n",
    "  * Compute the airspeed\n",
    "  * Compute the angle of attack\n",
    "  * Compute the sideslip angle\n",

    "Running the simulator requires passing a function that takes in a time value and produces a command. We'll learn about trim later, but trim trajectories are trajectories that can be flown with constant inputs. In reality the trim inputs can only be used for a small amount of time without any feedback due to disturbances. Once implemented, the following code will produce a trajectory that flights straight and steady without any need for modification."
