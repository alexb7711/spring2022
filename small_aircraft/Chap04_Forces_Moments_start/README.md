# Intro
This code implements a Python version of the simulator developed in "Small Unmanned Aircraft" written by Randal W. Beard and Timothy W. McLain.

This README covers
* Installation - creation of the virtual environment and installation of the `mav_sim` package
* Running the simulator - running each of the chapter projects
* Code compliance - ensuring that the code quality is maintained

# Installation
This project builds a `mav_sim` Python package. The package should be built within its own virtual environment. It has been tested with Python 3.9.9. It is highly recommended that you begin with a fresh installation of Python so that the virtual environment can control the modification and removal of all packages.

## Creating and activating a Python virtual environment
It is assummed that the python virtual environment is located at the same level as the `mav_sim` folder and is named `mav_venv`. This is not a requirement. To create the virtual environment, navigate the terminal to the parent of `mav_sim` and run the following command:

```
python -m venv mav_venv
```
If successful, the `mav_venv` should have been created. **Each time you open a terminal, you must activate the virtual environment**. From the parent folder, activate the virtual environment with the following command.

```
mav_venv\Scripts\activate
```

## Installing the `mav_sim` package
The `mav_sim` package is setup to be installed using the `pip` package installer. To install the `mav_sim` package, activate the `mav_venv` virtual environment, navigate to the parent directory of the `mav_sim` code, and run the following.
```
pip install -e .
```
The `-e` option allows the Python code to be modified without the need to rerun the installation. The `requirements.txt` file defines all of the package dependences. The `setup.py` file defines the creation of the `mav_sim` package.

# Running the simulator
Each chapter of the book has an associated Python script for running it. These scripts can be found in the `book_assignments` folder. Assuming that the **virtual environment has been activated** and that the terminal is in the parent folder of the `book_assignments` folder, the following command can be used to run the code for each chapter.
```
python .\book_assignments\mavsim_chap[num].py
```

For example, chapter 12's code can be run with the command
```
python .\book_assignments\mavsim_chap12.py
```

# Code Compliance
An effort has been made to ensure that the code maintains a certain level of quality. The current code is compliant with respect to three different static analysis tools. Two additional tools could be used to maintain further compliance on documentation and formatting.

## Compliant Tools
The code is compliant to a large degree with three different tools:
* Pylint
* Isort
* mypy

These tools are now explained in more detail.

### Pylint
Pylint is a tool that checks for errors in Python code, tries to enforce a coding standard and looks for code smells. It can also look for certain type errors, it can recommend suggestions about how particular blocks can be refactored and can offer you details about the code's complexity.

```
python -m pylint --jobs 0 --rcfile .pylintrc mav_sim/ book_assignments/
```

The `.pylintrc` file defines several exceptions to the standard Python style-guide. The code could be improved significantly by removing many of these exceptions.

### Isort
isort is a Python utility / library to sort imports alphabetically, and automatically separated into sections and by type. It provides a command line utility, Python library and plugins for various editors to quickly sort all your imports. It requires Python 3.6+ to run but supports formatting Python 2 code too.

```
python -m isort mav_sim book_assignments
```
Keep in mind that `isort` does not evaluate the code. It simply reorders the imports to be compliant.

### Mypy
Mypy is a static type checker for Python 3 and Python 2.7.

```
python -m mypy mav_sim book_assignments
```
The code is nearly completely `mypy` compliant. There are a few excpetions, which can be found by looking for the "type: ignore" comments that exist in some of the code.

## Other potential tools
In addition to the above tools, two more tools are installed by default. However, the code is not compliant with respect to these tools.

### Pydocstyle
pydocstyle is a static analysis tool for checking compliance with Python docstring conventions.

```
python -m pydocstyle mav_sim book_assignments
```
We are not compliant with `pydocstyle` due to the sheer amount of documentation that needed to be created. However, with a low amount of work, `pydocstyle` would be a great addition to the static code analysis tools already in place.

### Black
Black is the uncompromising Python code formatter. By using it, you agree to cede control over minutiae of hand-formatting. In return, Black gives you speed, determinism, and freedom from pycodestyle nagging about formatting. You will save time and mental energy for more important matters.

We do not use this tool as the code is formated in a way to help understand the material and `Black` destroys some of that formatting.

```
python -m black mav_sim book_assignments
```
