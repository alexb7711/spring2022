    "There will be no unit tests for the `line_manager(...)` and `fillet_manager(...)` functions. Furthermore, there are several scenarios where dividing by zero becomes an issue. As these are singularities that can be handled in various ways, there is not a correct answer. Thus, these cases may not all arise in the unit tests, but they will be tested in the problems 1 and 2.\n"
